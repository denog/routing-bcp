# Filters of AS196610

## Introduction
AS196610 (DE-CIX Academy) uses [Peering Manager](https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to configuer its routers (well, currently only one router running CISCO IOS XR). 

So all filters are auto-generated using templates. However, all filters contain a generic part filtering out unwanted prefixes, and this one is documented here.
